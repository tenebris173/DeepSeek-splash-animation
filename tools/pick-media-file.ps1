# Native "pick a media file" dialog for the dsh-splash-animation settings page.
#
# Spawned by the plugin's Host half, which cannot open a native dialog itself
# when DSH runs as a plain Node process (the CLI `dsh web` case). Windows ships
# WinForms with the .NET runtime that PowerShell already loads, so this needs no
# dependency and no install step.
#
# Contract with the caller:
#   - STA is required: the common file dialog is a COM object and throws on an
#     MTA thread, which is why the caller must pass -STA (Windows PowerShell 5.1
#     defaults to STA, but `pwsh` 7 defaults to MTA).
#   - The selected path is written to -OutFile as UTF-8, NOT to stdout. A console
#     writes text through the system ANSI code page (GBK on a Chinese Windows), so
#     a path with non-ASCII characters comes back as mojibake when the caller
#     decodes it as UTF-8 — which is exactly how the first version turned
#     `开屏动画.mp4` into `????.mp4`. A file carries its own encoding and cannot be
#     corrupted by a code page.
#   - Nothing is written when the user cancels, so "no file" means cancel.
#   - Diagnostics go to stderr, never into the result.
#   - Exit code 0 covers both "picked" and "cancelled"; a non-zero code means the
#     dialog itself failed, which the caller reports as an environment problem
#     rather than as a user cancellation.
